Here is a list of other, smaller or sillier software that I've worked on...

[`gltps`](https://github.com/dill/gltps): R code to run Geodesic Low-rank Thin Plate Spline (GLTPS) models a la Wang, H. and Ranalli, M.G. (2007). Low-rank smoothing splines on complicated domains. Biometrics 63(1), 209--217.

[`vis.concurvity`](https://gist.github.com/dill/c148e4629333212ec7be): visualise concurvity between GAM terms.

[`beyonce`](https://github.com/dill/beyonce): set of colour palettes for R based on the Beyonc√© palettes provided at [beyoncepalettes.tumblr.com](http://beyoncepalettes.tumblr.com).

[`wiggly`](https://gist.github.com/dill/b9d3786d284631c78663): animation to visualise derivatives, 2nd derivatives and hence GAM penalties

[`watchr`](https://gist.github.com/3752343): an small R script that checks if a (R markdown) file has changed, then [`knit`](http://yihui.name/knitr/)s it.

[`horse`](https://github.com/dill/horse): an R library for taking people's tweets, generating a 1st order Markov chain and then using this to generate text that looks like their tweets. A minimal example can be found [here](https://github.com/dill/horse/wiki).


[`RXMPP`](https://github.com/dill/RXMPP): an R library for communicating via the XMPP protocol (using the [`wocky`](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/wocky) library). This is useful if you want to get R to tell you your simulations have finished via Google Talk.

[`fw2dot`](https://gist.github.com/dill/f852a82d8733abe717fb): quick hack to get the `foodweb` output into a format compatible with [GraphViz](http://graphviz.org/). This allows you to nicely plot which functions call each other in an R package.

### Contributions to other people's software

[`rphylopic`](https://github.com/sckott/rphylopic): added support to use base graphics for this package (which allows one to add silhouettes of animals to R plots).

[`stegasaur`](https://github.com/richfitz/stegasaur): added functionality to hide the code that generated a plot in the plot itself to this package (which implements [steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) in R).

[`staRtrek`](https://github.com/karawoo/staRtrek): an R library for accessing information about the TV series Star Trek. Joint work with internetfriends from Twitter.
